*roxcomposer* is a software development framework for building microservice architectures. It consists of various interlocking parts:

* a service communication and routing protocol based on Google protocol buffers
* a service base class written in Python which allows easy implementation of Python services including a logging interface
* a control process that allows configurable REST endpoints for starting services, defining pipelines and injecting messages into a pipeline via HTTP
