# Contributing

We use GitHub to manage our contributions.
Contributions take the form of pull requests that will be reviewed by the core team.

* If you are a new contributor see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)
* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.
* If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your idea on the respective [issue](https://github.com/droxit/roxcomposer/issues) or create a [new issue](https://github.com/droxit/roxcomposer/issues/new) if it does not exist. This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration.

## Steps to Contribute

* Read the [ROXcomposer Wiki](https://github.com/droxit/roxcomposer/wiki) to getting to know how to use the ROXcomposer for local development.
* You want to work on a GitHub issue? Check if it is not already assigned to someone. If it is free, you claim it by commenting on the issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.
* If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them and one of the core team or the original poster will clarify it.

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the dev branch and, if needed, rebase to the current dev branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with dev you may be asked to rebase your changes.
* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.
* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
* If you changed any Python modules, make sure it follows the [PEP 8 Coding Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Pull requests with new features
Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

Make sure to include `Closes #<issue number>` or `Fixes #<issue number>` in the pull request description.

## Finally
Have fun while contributing!!
